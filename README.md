# Econometrics Applications 2
Created for course of Econometrics Application 2 in Spring 2023 at ISI Kolkata taken under Prof. Nachiketa Chattopadhyay.

Includes four projects done. Relevant folders are listed below in parantheses -

I. **Final project on Women Agency** - Studied the impact of two different interventions among women in India using the IHDS data available for 2005 and 2011 - (women ihds)

1. **Leveraging Technology for Women's Empowerment**  - Impact of mobile phones on women’s economic freedom, awareness of health issues, and decision-making ability in family using DID method.
2. **Does Community Memberships Improve Women’s Agency?**  - Impact of women-specific community membership on women’s economic freedom, awareness of health issues, and decision-making ability in 
   family using various matching methods including Mahalanobis and propensity scoring methods.

II. **Mid semester project on CNNS survey data** - Applying methods learnt in class in a real life dataset - CNNS survey data - Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS; 2016–18) for West Bengal, state of India. - (Non-parametric regression_CNNS)

1. Studied the association between RBC folate and BMI for adolescents in West Bengal using parametric and semi-parametric methods and derived marginal effects using PArtically Linear model and Ichimura's Single index model. 
**Finding** - We have used all parametric, non-parametric and semi-parametric methods on data. We find there is a overall positive association between Z scores of BMI adjusted for age and RBC folate which is supported by literature. Also we do a heterogeneity test bydividing the sample into obese, normal and underweight and find assymetric results across the groups which are statistically significant
2. Analysed the determinants for obesity among adolescent of West Bengal

III. **Simulating distributios in python** - Creating functions of distribution in python and Simulation  of data drawn from those distribution using accept reject method and Inverse Transform method. (Simulation Distribution)

IV. **Experimental task in Quantile regression** - Replicating the wage-education equation(Mincer equation) using IHDS data in a quantile regression framework. Finding - Effect of education increases for people having
higher incomes. - (quantile_REG)
